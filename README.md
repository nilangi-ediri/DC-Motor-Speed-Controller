# DC-Motor-Speed-Controller

• Conducted as a project for the module “Embedded Systems” in the second year of the MEng. degree.
• The hardware set-up was successfully built which consisted of a dc motor with encoder, power supply, LCD display and the microcontroller; ‘STM32F407 discovery board’.
• The DC motor speed was effectively controlled using a control system designed through MATLAB Simulink and the ‘STM32F407’ microcontroller.
